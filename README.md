#Risc Os Test Patterns

##Synopsis

This is a selection of basic routines which I have used over the
years for display adjustments. They were orginally used with 
some Custom VIDC and VIDC2 modes on a umber of machines Notably
the A3020 .

## Status
I revived this project trun on Risc s for the Raspberry-Pi as that
is a conviently small platform. The original aim for this
project was to generate some test patterns to use on a  TYV demo
in the demo room for buying a new TV, but it the end I just
bought a cheap TV from the supermark4et.


The files are saved as text but you should be able import them into
!Zap, or !StrongEd and run/save them as BASIC.
